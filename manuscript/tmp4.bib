	abstract = {This chapter presents typical mid-IR (MIR) and near-IR (NIR) spectra of different clay mineral families and discusses how basic information on crystal chemistry can be derived. MIR spectroscopy has been applied to clay minerals studies since the early 1960s, but in more recent decades NIR spectroscopy has become more commonly applied to the study of clay minerals. These complementary techniques provide information concerning their structure, ordering or chemical composition, including different types of isomorphous substitutions within clay mineral species. The emphasis is on interpretation of the MIR and NIR spectra of selected representative specimens of the main clay mineral groups, based on the well-known work of V.C. Farmer and on more recent published literature.},
