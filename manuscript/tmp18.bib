  abstract = {Dry-matter accumulation was greater in staked than in unstaked plants of the lesser yam (Dioscorea esculenta). Staking, N and K application tended to increase the proportion of dry matter diverted into the tubers. Staking was the most important factor in increasing total tuber production, which was one and a half times greater in staked than in unstaked plants. Leaf-area development was closely and positively related to vine growth, and since staking and N application encouraged vine growth these treatments therefore led to the production of plants with greater leaf area. Leaf-area duration was increased by staking and N application and was closely and positively related to tuber yield. Staking and N application increased tuber number per plant while K application increased the size of individual tubers. Staking and K application increased bulking rate and both treatments increased the period of bulking by causing earlier tuber initiation.},
