	abstract = {This paper discusses the potential of soil diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS) for rapid and cheap soil analysis and its application to digital soil mapping. We consider both visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) and mid infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy, the use of multivariate calibrations, the development of soil spectral libraries and the cost and beneﬁts of soil DRS. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts on the potential use of the techniques for digital soil mapping and soil science generally.},
